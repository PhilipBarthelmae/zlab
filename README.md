# zlab - A template for the analysis of the Z resonance in the dimuon spectrum for physics laboratory courses

This repository contains an extensive data driven analysis of the Z resonance as part of a bachelors thesis as well as a shortened version suitable for  physics laboratory courses complete with excercises for the students to follow as well as introductions for the required library's.
The basis for the analysis are two data sets from the CERN Open Data Portal.
The data set itself is not contained in this repository due to its large file size, but can easily be created using the GetData.ipynb notebook which also contains the neccesary instructions.

The contents of this repository are:
- Thesis - Z boson analysis for physics laboratory courses using CERN Open Data.pdf
  This thesis contains an exhaustive analysis of the Z resonance as well as the neccessary theoretical background.

- ZAnalysisThesis.ipynb
  This jupyter notebook contains the entire analysis behind the thesis.

- ZExcerciseTutors.ipynb
  This jupyter notebook is a shortened version of the analysis complete with introductions to the neccessary libraries and excercises with solutions suitible for a lab course.
  Its use for educational purposes is encouraged.

- ZExcerciseStudens.ipynb
  This jupyter notebook is is the Students version of the ZExcercise with the solutions removed.
  Its use for educational purposes is encouraged.

- GetData.ipynb
  This notebook can be used to automatically construct the neccesary data set for the analysis from two data sets provided by the CERN Open Data Portal. All relevant information is given in the notebook.

  ## Get started

  Clone this repostitory and set up an environment using the library's in requirements.txt. Run the GetData.ipynb to automatically create the neccessary dataset.
